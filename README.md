# CSP Prisoner's Dilemma, Summer 2018
### Initial Setup
1. FORK this repository into your own account.
2. CLONE that copy onto your desktop.
3. Remember to only make changes to the file that you are assigned.
4. Team0 through Team5 will be used by the Bucknell participants. 
5. Team6 through Team10 will be used by the FGCU participants.
### Preparing Your Repo for Tournament
Before your PULL REQUEST for the actual tournament, you need to complete the following:
1. Delete all files with the '.pyc' extension. 
2. Delete the 'tournament.txt' file (or simply remove it from the repo location)
3. Confirm that you haven't changed the code for any files other than the team number that you were assigned. 
### Syncing Up the Repos
Now you are ready to bring your code into the main branch of the teacher's repo. These directions will be slightly different depending on if you have the new or old version of Github Desktop. 
##### Old Version:
1. Go into the 'Changes' tab, and COMMIT your changes. You will need to write something in the 'Summary' text-box in order to do this.
2. Click the 'Sync' button in the top right corner.
3. Click the 'Pull Request' button in the top right corner, and submit a request to the main repository. This will bring your code into the main branch.
##### New Version:
1. Click the 'Fetch Origin' tab/icon at the top of the page.
2. On top toolbar, choose 'Branch' and then 'Create Pull Request'
3. This will take you to the Github website. Click the green button to submit a pull request, and then confirm that you want to submit the request.

### Run the Tournament
Once all students have submitted 'Pull Requests', and the teacher has accepted them into the main code base, the tournament is ready to be run from the master branch on his/her machine. If you want students to be able to run the same tournament on their own devices, they need to update their FORK with the changes that were pulled in from everyone in the class. This would need to be done in the Git Terminal, and the directions can now be found on the official Github documentation here: [Github Syncing a Fork] (https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/)
